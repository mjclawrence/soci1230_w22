## SOCI 1230

## Winter 2022

## Week One, Class One



### Getting Started
- Welcome! Today want to do introductions: of me, of you, and of our section's project and data
- Before we begin, some additional installation in R
- I am a sociologist, mostly using quantitative methods. My work focuses on higher education, inequality, and mobility. Those are the topics our section will focus on as well.
	- I agree with Paul Tough: "Many of the most fundamental questions about what kind of country the United States will become - like whether it will be a land of opportunity for all, or a land of privilege for a few - are playing out in the lives and decisions of the nation's college students."
	- That is becoming even more true. As Tough notes, "In prewar America, it may have taken pluck and elbow grease to rise above your birth, but in postwar America, what it usually took was a college degree."
	- That means that studying inequality and mobility means studying higher education.
	- But there's an odd thing about this research. With data like the data Chetty collected, we can know a lot about students' social and economic backgrounds before college and after college. And we compare before and after to know if individuals experience mobility or social reproduction. But most of the research doesn't connect those measures to what students do *during* college. That's what we'll do by merging Chetty's data with surveys of students at hundreds of the same colleges during the same period Chetty's data on students' backgrounds and outcomes were measured.
	- The question for our section is: What experiences during college are associated with mobility after college?
	- Based on the reading for today, what else do we need to think about when we think about mobility in higher education?
- Course details: Small assignments each week, most of which will involve R. All leading to a big project during the last week that we will do collectively (or maybe in two groups).
- Your introductions: name, major, year, any background with R or data
- Turn to modules on Canvas
