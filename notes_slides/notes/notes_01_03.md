## Week One, Class Three

## Arum and Roksa

- "What is accomplished and what fails to be accomplished at college is thus central to the transitions of many emerging adults."
- Metaphors of higher education: sieve, incubator, temple, hub

- What is the historical narrative they are suggesting about how higher education has changed?
  - From academic and moral development to personal growth and well-being. Emphasis now is on self-exploration and social well-being.
    - Why does that happen?
  - From faculty in charge to administrators, students, and parents in charge
  - From faculty determining what counts as knowledge to employers determining what counts as skills
    - Skills include "other-directed" skills: getting along with others, tolerance for diversity, socially suave, for example
- Summed up in Durkehim's line, the goal of education is the "socialization of the human being."

- If that shift is true, what does it mean for how we measure what students learn?
  - Social class-specific
- What are the big buckets? 
  - Social life: Getting along with others, finding balance
  - Personal growth: Crucial product is a personality, feel more fully developed
  - Academic skills (critical thinking, complex reading, writing): measured in how much you work?
- What variables have we seen that would matter?
