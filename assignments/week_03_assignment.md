## Week Three Assignment

In this assignment you will work in groups to improve sections of our collective app. One person should submit your group's edited app.R script via Canvas by noon on Monday, January 31.

### Groups

Andy, Hanwen, Sophia: *Mobility Correlations* tab and TFS descriptions

Dilay, Evan, Jaime: *Summary By Mobility* tab and CSS descriptions

Alejandro, Becca, Omar: *Correlations Summary Plot* tab and introduction/welcome text

### Instructions

Your assignment is to work in groups to improve sections of our collective app. Each group is responsible for one of the tabs. Review the code for your tab in the app.R script; the version we finished in class today is available [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjclawrence/soci1230_w22/main/final_project/app.R). If there is anything unusual or new in the code for your tab you will need to explain it to the rest of the class on Monday. 

Your main task is to fix the plots. Focus on labels, legends, colors, themes, font size, titles, etc. You can also change the tab name. Basically get your tab ready for a published site and a presentation. Think of a site visitor who has not spent the last three weeks digging into the data as deeply we have. You may want to add a text output to your tab describing how to interpret the plot and/or suggesting inputs to find interesting results. 

Each group also has another assignment. The groups working on the TFS and CSS descriptions should clean up the names, descriptions, and summaries for those datasets. See notebook_02_01 and notebook_02_02 for examples. The group working on introduction/welcome text will receive an email from me with some suggestions for next steps.

Good luck!
