# Course Description
In this course, we will gain exposure to the entire data science pipelineâ€”obtaining and cleaning large and messy data sets, exploring these data and creating engaging visualizations, and communicating insights from the data in a meaningful manner. During morning sessions, we will learn the tools and techniques required to explore new and exciting data sets. During afternoon sessions, we will use the tools of data science to examine how experiences in college are associated with social and economic mobility after college. We will combine sources of "big data" with survey research to produce visualizations and exploratory analyses that consider the importance of higher education for shaping life chances.

# Course Requirements
There will be four mini assignments (each worth 10% of the final grade). The final project, including a public presentation during the last week of the course, will be worth 40% of the final grade. Attendance and participation make up the remaining 20% of the final grade.

# Course Readings
There are no required textbooks. Readings are accessible online or posted on the Canvas site as necessary.

# Software
We will use the open source statistical software R through R Studio. We will also use R Markdown to promote reproducibility and transparency. The four assignments are structured to help make R as accessible as possible, but students should expect to spend additional time learning and practicing with the software in order to become comfortable enough to use it in their own analyses. Some additional resources for learning R through R Studio have been collected on the Canvas site; you are invited to add other helpful tips and tools you discover to this site.
