## Redoing the RACE variables

The survey has a different question for each race/ethnicity value (`RACE1` to `RACE9`). It would be helpful to combine all the possible values into one variable to be able to make the kinds of plots we saw earlier. There are various ways to do that. Here's one.

Make a new dataframe called `race_variables` (based on `css_summary`) with only the rows that include "RACE" in the `Name` variable and "yes" in the `Summary` variable.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

The `RACEGROUP` row is unnecessary. Exclude it by using `str_detect()`.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###


The `Description` variable has info that we want to use as the values of the `Label` variable. How can we make that happen? And change the value of the `Name` variable to `RACE_ETHNICITY` so it better fits the values.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

Almost done. Remove all the rows with `RACE` in the `Name` column from `css_summary`.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

Then use `bind_rows()` to add the `race_variables` dataframe to the end of `css_summary`. We'll make a new dataframe here called `css_summary2`.

```{r}
css_summary2 <- bind_rows(css_summary, race_variables)
```

What else could you do with the new Race/Ethnicity question?

# Introducing Correlations and Associations

(We'll come back to R in a few minutes...)

Here is a link to the slides on Canvas if you want to review them: 
https://middlebury.instructure.com/files/1631192/download?download_frd=1

Let's see how Opportunity Insights gets their correlations.

```{r}
mrc2 <- read_csv("https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mrc_table2.csv")

mrc10 <- read_csv("https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mrc_table10.csv")
```

## A quick example from the College Navigator of how web scraping fits in...

```{r}
library(rvest)
url <- "https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=middlebury+college&s=all&id=230959#general"
```

Need the xpath for our table...

```{r}
middlebury_admissions_table <- url |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(xpath = '') |> 
  html_table()

middlebury_admissions_table
```

Fortunately Chetty's team already assembled all the data for us. But we still need to combine their Table 2 and Table 10 datasets. The `bind_rows()` function doesn't do what we want. A new `join()` function will. 

```{r}
mrc <- left_join(mrc10, mrc2)
```

Let's start with a figure. Using the `mrc` data frame, make a scatterplot with `scorecard_rej_rate_2013` on the x axis and `mr_ktop1_pq1` on the y-axis.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

To calculate correlation coefficients, the easiest thing to do is to use the `cor()` function.

```{r}
cor(mrc$scorecard_rej_rate_2013, mrc$mr_ktop1_pq1)
```

But that alone is rarely enough. Often there will be NAs in one of those variables. With means we used `na.rm = TRUE` but with correlations we'll instead add the `use = "complete"` option.

```{r}
cor(mrc$scorecard_rej_rate_2013, mrc$mr_ktop1_pq1, use = "complete")
```

If you want to stick with tidy formatting...

```{r}
mrc |> 
  select(scorecard_rej_rate_2013, mr_ktop1_pq1) |> 
  cor(use = "complete")
```


Does that look like what Opportunity Insights reports?

Just like with the means functions we have seen, we need to get weighted correlations rather than regular old correlations. We'll need the `weights` package for that.

```{r}
install.packages("weights") # hashtag this line after installing
library(weights)
```

The weighted correlation function is `wtd.cor(, w =)`. We'll use the `count` variable again for the weight with the Opportunity Insights data.

```{r}
wtd.cor(mrc$scorecard_rej_rate_2013, mrc$mr_ktop1_pq1, w = mrc$count)
```

We get more than just the correlation coefficient here. Did we see anything this morning to help us only keep the correlation coefficient?

# Correlations With CSS Variables

```{r}
css_means <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjclawrence/soci1230_w22/main/data/css_means_mobility_withno.csv")
```

Make a scatterplot using the `css_means` dataframe showing the relationship between `ACADEMIC_SELFCONCEPT.scale_mean` and `k_rank`. Don't worry about the size of the points right now.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###


Before we move on: any way to use other string functions to remove "_mean" from all the variable names that have it?

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

Back to the correlations. Open the spreadsheet view to see why the weights are tricky here. Each *college* has a value for `n_responses` and each *question per college* has a different proportion NA. We want to only use the number of valid responses for our weight variable. How do we do that?

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

Let's start by pulling all the variables we need in a new dataframe called `cor_df`.

```{r}
cor_df <- css_means |> 
  select(campus_id, 
         n_responses, 
         k_rank,
         starts_with("ACADEMIC_SELFCONCEPT")) # complement to ends_with()
```

Now we'll create the new weight, called `n_responses_nona`. 

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###


We're finally ready to calculate the weighted correlation.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

Now how can we make a weighted scatterplot?

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE CHUNK ###

Let's think about the possible association between `HPW10.hours0` (zero hours spent partying per week) and `k_rank_cond_parq5` (average rank for kids who grow up in the top quintile). What would you expect? What do you find?

# Exercise With Other Variables

Take a few minutes to explore how other CSS questions are associated with mobility variables. What is a relationship where you would expect a negative association? What is a relationship where you would expect a positive association? What is a relationship where you would expect no association?



# To try tonight: Any way to easily work with all the responses to a question at once?
