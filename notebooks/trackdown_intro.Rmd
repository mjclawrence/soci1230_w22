See [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/yihui-xie.html) for info on the `trackdown` package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(trackdown)
```

```{r}
update_file("trackdown_intro.Rmd")
```

It will update.

Now go to Google Drive and make some changes.

Ok, in Google Drive I added this sentence and saved the file.

```{r}
update_file("trackdown_intro.Rmd")
```

Now I need to download the file in R.

```{r}
download_file("trackdown_intro.Rmd")
```

Then I'll make some more changes here.

Changes...changes...changes...

And I'll update the file so those changes are available in Google Drive.

```{r}
update_file("trackdown_intro.Rmd")
```

There was a weird thing that just happened when I updated the file before saving it in R. Save it before you update it!
